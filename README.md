# TextWeatherAPI


This application is a small demo of API passing. The first API used is from http://api.openweathermap.org to exstract realtime current weather through an http request. I used the request library to simplify my query string. The next API is twilio, which allows for text messages to be send through and HTTPS reques. Many more inovative updates to come.
