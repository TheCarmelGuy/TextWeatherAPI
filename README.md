# TextWeatherAPI


This application is a small demo of API passing. The first API used is from http://api.openweathermap.org to extract realtime current weather through an HTTP request. I used the request library to simplify querystring passing. The next API is twilio, which allows for text messages to be processed as an HTTPS request. Many more inovative updates to come.
